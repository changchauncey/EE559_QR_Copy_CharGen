# TinyURL

•	Developed a full stack web app using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.js) to deliver TinyURL-like URL shortening service with a REST API backend.

•	Designed a user management system to perform real-time data analysis and visualization by Angular-chart and web socket.

•	Used Redis and LRU Map as cache layer over MongoDB to improve performance and dockerize the app to scale up  as multiple instances.

•	Deployed server containers under Nginx for load balancing and reverse proxy to handle 10k qps and migrated from MongoDB to Apache Cassandra to create a distributed data store.
